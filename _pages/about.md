Hi! I am a fourth-year PhD student at Oxford University, interested in multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, AI safety and LLMs.
I am lucky to be working with [Philip Torr](https://torrvision.com), [Joao Henriques](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~joao/), and [Jakob Foerster](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/).

I'm always interested in meeting new people and in new collaborations. If you'd like to get in touch with me, please email me at frtim at robots dot ox dot ac dot uk.
